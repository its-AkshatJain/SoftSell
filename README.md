# SoftSell Assistant - Chat Widget

A modern and interactive chat widget designed for the SoftSell platform using React, Framer Motion, and Cohere's API for AI text generation. This widget allows users to interact with a virtual assistant to get help with selling their software licenses, featuring dynamic animations, a glass-like effect, and smooth transitions powered by Framer Motion.

## Features Implemented

* **Interactive Chat UI**: A sleek chat interface that supports both user and assistant messages.
* **Cohere API Integration**: Fetches text responses from Cohere's text generation API to answer user queries.
* **Typing Indicator**: Simulates the assistant typing to make the conversation feel more human.
* **Predefined Questions**: Displays a set of example questions that users can click to interact with the assistant.
* **Responsive Design**: The chat widget is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
* **Animated Transitions**: Smooth animations for opening/closing the chat widget and message transitions using **Framer Motion**.
* **Dark and Light Mode**: Integrated with a theme context for light/dark mode based on user preference.
* **Icons for Interaction**: The chat widget uses `react-icons` to make the UI more engaging.

## Design Choices

* **Glass-like Effect**: The chat widget has a frosted glass appearance, achieved by using semi-transparent background colors and borders. This effect is intended to give the widget a sleek, modern, and professional look, fitting well with contemporary design trends.
* **Framer Motion**: To add an interactive and fluid user experience, **Framer Motion** is used for animations such as smooth transitions for messages, popups, and button effects.
* **Font Choice**: The project uses **Poppins** as the primary font, which is known for its clean, modern, and professional appearance. This enhances the overall aesthetic of the chat widget.
* **Icons for Visual Appeal**: The use of icons like `FaRobot`, `FiMessageCircle`, and `FiSend` enhances the user interface and provides immediate visual feedback during interactions.
